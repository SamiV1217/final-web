My CSS work matches accessibility guidelines that were presented in class. 
I ensured that my images have alt tags and ensured that the color contrast is sufficient as well. 
I also walked through my website and tried to make sure that the flow was easy to follow. 
The font styles will adjust based on the browser used and are clear as to what they are communicating. 
My interactive elements include arrows and hover color changes, which is clear and easy to decipher. 
If I made improvements, I think I would adjust font sizes and make my footer more robust.
